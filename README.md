# Numerical Analysis Methods

## Overview
This is a collection of MATLAB functions I wrote for my Numerical Analysis class. It includes polynomial root-finding methods (the Bisection Method, Newton's Method and the Secant Method), function interpolation methods (Lagrange Polynomial, Neville's Method and Newton's Divided Differences Method) and linear interpolation/visualization of triangular surfaces.

## Requirements
In order to run this code, you need to have a working copy of MATLAB and some previous experience with it.
